In CLR, GC serves as an automatic memory manager. 

Garbage collection occurs when one of the following conditions true:

- Low physical memory.
- Memory used by allocated objects on the heap surpasses threshold.
- The GC.Collect method is called.

CLR organized the memory heap into 

- Large object heap. Large object heap contains large object that are 85,000 bytes and larger (usually array). 
- Small object heap

    - Generation 0
    - Generation 1
    - Generation 2
    
Garbage collection has the following phases

- A marking phase that finds and creates a list of all live objects
- A relocating phases that updates the references to the object that will be compacted
- A compacting phase that reclaims space occupied by the dead objects and compacts the surviving objects toward the older end of the segment.
